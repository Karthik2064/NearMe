The architecture symbolizes the connection between the arts and spirituality, creative activity and the divine.[6][7][8] The temple wall carvings display all the 108 karanas from the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni, and these postures form a foundation of Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance.[4][6] it is the only Shiva temple common to both the Pancha Sabha Thalam and the Pancha Bhuta Thalam.
